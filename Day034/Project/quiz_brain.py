'''HTML entities are special codes used in web development to represent reserved
characters, symbols, and characters not easily available on a standard keyboard. 
They ensure that the browser displays the intended character correctly, rather than 
interpreting it as HTML code.'''

'''If we don't unescape HTML entities then the question will be displayed as 
"The character Plum from &quot;No Game No Life&quot; is a girl." there are so many unwanted symbols.'''
